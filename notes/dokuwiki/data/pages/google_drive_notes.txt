==== lazy load  ====
today | 2025-03-30
  * After going into a folder, if I press ctrl-a, only the first 50 files are selected in the google drive. If the folder has 70 items, I have to scroll down to select the remaining 20 items. I think google drive is doing some kind of lazy load to optimize on performance. This behavior is unexpected and annoying.
  * FWIW, One drive does the same with a different default. It loads 100 files first and then you have to scroll past them and press ctrl-a to load the next 100 etc.,
