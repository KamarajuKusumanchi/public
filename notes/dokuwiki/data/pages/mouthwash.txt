tl;dr: The “Crest Pro-Health Advanced Complete Care” mouthwash from Costco seems to be the best mouthwash out there.

The mouthwashes labelled "anticavity" have fluoride to strengthen enamel and prevent tooth decay.

The mouthwashes labelled "antiseptic" or "antiplaque" or "antimicrobial" have ingredients like essential oils (eucalyptol, menthol, etc.) or cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) to kill bacteria that cause plaque and gingivitis.

There are mouthwashes that do both.

Some mouthwashes have alcohol and some do not.
