  * I did an ACH push from the checking account at a bank to the brokerage account at TD Ameritrade to deposit funds into the brokerage account.
  * The brokerage account received the funds the next day.
  * <WRAP>
TD Ameritrade brokerage account shows the transaction in
My Account -> History & Statements -> Transactions \\ 
-> Type = All Transaction types
</WRAP>
  * <WRAP>
But it does not show it in
My Account -> History & Statements -> Transactions \\ 
-> Type = "Deposit & Withdrawls"
</WRAP>
  * <WRAP>
It also does not show up in
My Account -> Deposits & Transfers -> Activity \\
-> Completed Transactions
</WRAP>
  * The customer service representative told me that since the ACH transfer originated from the bank (as opposed to TD Ameritrade) it is considered a passive ACH and so will not show up in the above screens.
