==== why zim ====
Reasons on why I use Zim:
  * Zim : (vim, notepad++) :: book : page :: "collection of documents" : "single document" :: directory : file .\\ For example, you can have links in one page that point to another page. But all the pages belong to a single notebook.
  * Files are stored in plain text
  * Open source
  * Written in python
  * Works in both Linux and Windows.
