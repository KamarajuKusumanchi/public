  * People with Parkinson’s disease have an abnormal protein called alpha-synuclein in their nerves.
  * A medical technology company called CND Life Sciences developed a skin biopsy that can detect this protein.
  * The test involves taking skin samples near ankle, knee, shoulder.
  * It costs {\$1,500: insurance, \$995: patient}
\\
  * Parkinson's disease
    * Doctors normally diagnose it by symptoms
    * But symptoms take years to appear
    * It is the second-most common age-related neurodegenerative condition
    * It is a major driver of disability, dementia and death.
    * A sleep behavior disorder is a precursor to Parkinson’s
    * It is a progressive disorder where brain cells are lost over time
    * Parkinson’s occurs when cells deep in the brain that produce dopamine, which coordinates movement, become impaired or die.
    * Symptoms include tremors, stiffness, slow movements and problems with balance.
    * Patients also have non-motor complications such as depression, sleep disorders and pain.
    * It usually occurs in older people, more often men.
    * There is no cure, but drugs and other treatments help relieve symptoms.
