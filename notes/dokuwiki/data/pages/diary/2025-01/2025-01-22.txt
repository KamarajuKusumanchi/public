  * Something wrong with Interactive Brokers and Fidelity's data today. Both are showing that BRK.B's market cap is \$663 bln. But Finviz is showing it as \$995 bln and Yahoo Finance is showing \$993 bln.
    * Tried calling IBKR customer service. But I was unable to reach them.
    * Called Fidelity customer service and explained the issue. They are looking into it. I also notified them about the issue using the "Feedback" button.

Conclusion: Fidelity's customer service is awesome. +1 for Fidelity and -1 for IBKR.
