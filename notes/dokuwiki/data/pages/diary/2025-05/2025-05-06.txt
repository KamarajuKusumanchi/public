    * statistics.quantiles()
      * Divide data into n continuous intervals with equal probability. Returns a list of n - 1 cut points separating the intervals.
      * Set n to 4 for quartiles (the default). Set n to 10 for deciles. Set n to 100 for percentiles which gives the 99 cuts points that separate data into 100 equal sized groups.
