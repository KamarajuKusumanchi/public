Update 1:
  * I made the following notes while reading https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/social-security-tax-limit-jumps-for-2025 but afterwards, I found 
  * https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/colafacts2025.pdf and
  * https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/colafacts2024.pdf
which are more comprehensive and less wordy. It is better to go with https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/colafacts2025.pdf than my notes here.

Notes from https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/social-security-tax-limit-jumps-for-2025

  * This tax limit is also known as "wage cap". It is the amount of income subject to Social Security payroll tax.
