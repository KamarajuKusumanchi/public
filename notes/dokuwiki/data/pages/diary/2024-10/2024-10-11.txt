  * Dream Finders , Lennar , PulteGroup , Toll Brothers , and Taylor Morrison all have a move-up component to their business.
  * Toll Brothers has been a big favorite, trading at a discount compared with its peers
  * Meritage Homes's competition is the existing-home market.
  * Lennar is more entry-level.
  * Roughly 30% of the nation’s land is owned by the government. It is skewed to the Western U.S. 
  * North Carolina - endangered market
  * Midwest - affordable
