  * Basically, after the 2008 financial crisis, banks have become strict about giving loans. So companies started borrowing from asset managers ("private credit"). Looks like the asset managers did not do enough due diligence when lending the monies. For example, same collateral was being pledged more than once, Companies like Blackrock, MS, Jeffries have exposure to this scandal.
