Q. Where to park cash temporarily?

A. Checkout Fidelity brokerage account. You can configure your sweep account to their money market funds which gives 5% yield. You can pay bills from that account using bill pay, buy stocks for investment etc , Any new cash (ex:- from dividends) will  automatically be swept into money market funds. This is the most hassle free setup IMHO.

I am not affiliated with them ... Just a happy customer.

Also, Fidelity has a cool feature called "Full View" wherein you can add all your other accounts (brokerage, 401k, bank accounts etc.,) and track your net worth for free.
