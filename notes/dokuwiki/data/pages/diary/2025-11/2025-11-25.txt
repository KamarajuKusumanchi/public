FWIR (From what I read), credit card surcharges used to be illegal. Then there was a class action lawsuit by merchants against the credit card companies. The merchants won the case in Jan 2013 making the surcharges legal.

After that, it became a state level issue. Some states tried to resist and that resulted in more lawsuits by merchants. They became legal in NJ since Aug 2023.

Currently, there are only 5 states where surcharges are illegal - California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, and Texas.
