    * In 2023, Tesla paid \$1.23 billion in warranty claims. In 2024, it paid \$1.45 billion.
    * Tesla's vehicles are covered by its Basic Vehicle Limited Warranty for four years or 50,000 miles
    * The EV battery and drive unit are covered for a minimum of 8 years or 100,000 miles
    * Water damage isn't covered by Tesla's warranty
    * Tesla's lists several limitations and items that are not covered. This includes damage caused by "animal or insect droppings," "tree sap," and even "water,"
    * The wording in the warranty regarding water is vague enough to give Tesla an out from covering a variety of repairs.
    * Tesla refused to pay for the \$7,900 replacement of the rear drive unit — a repair normally covered by the warranty — because water was found in the high voltage harness cover
    * Simply taking a Cybertruck through a car wash has caused it to stop working in some cases, and may even void the warranty
    * In fact, the owner's manual of Cybertruck discourages using automatic car washes at all.
    * problems with the steering suspension in the Model S and Model X have been blamed for multiple accidents
    * Tesla has been overestimating odometer mileages in order to end the warranty period prematurely
    * It seems Tesla may be using a patented algorithm that uses charging data and driving patterns, instead of wheel rotation, to measure mileage.

Alleghany’s board accepted the price of \$848.02 despite some misgivings.

    * CSX’s CEO Joseph Hinrichs
    * Union Pacific and BNSF dominate freight traffic West of the Mississippi River and Norfolk Southern and CSX in the East.
    * When Alleghany told Berkshire that it wouldn’t evaluate Berkshire’s offer without consulting its bankers at Goldman Sachs, Buffett cut the price that Berkshire would pay for Alleghany by over \$25 million to account for the fee.
    * Buffett also doesn’t like deal terms to leak publicly and he is willing to scotch a deal if that happens.
    * So if Berkshire does make a move on CSX, look for an all-cash offer that includes a go-shop period that would allow the railroad to consider other offers. That’s what happened with Alleghany.
    * it could cost over \$80 billion to buy CSX
    * Berkshire is sitting on over \$300 billion of cash including about \$90 billion at its holding company that doesn’t carry any potential regulatory restriction on usage that occur with the larger amount of cash at its insurance units.
