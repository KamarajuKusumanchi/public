    * In his book about the history of interest, The Price of Time, Edward Chancellor presents a chart of interest rates going back to about 3,000 B.C. Other than very briefly in the 1920s, interest rates were never zero, let alone negative, until the past few years.

    * We consider three factors: the nature of the business, the management, and the price.
    * In the past five years [through March 31], companies owned by Davis New York Venture grew their earnings by 11.7%, versus 9.7% for the S&P 500. Yet, our companies sold for 10.1 times earnings, 44% less than the index’s 18.1 times.
    * we own a lot of incumbents
    * Capital One has been a fintech company since the start. It uses data science to market financial services. It is still run by its founder, Richard Fairbank. The bank pays a high rate on its deposit base. It is a big issuer of credit cards, primarily to working people, not big spenders. The best analogy is Progressive [PGR], a data-science company disguised as an insurer. Progressive realized early on that there is no bad risk; there is only bad pricing.
    * Wells has been in regulators’ crosshairs for seven years or so.
    * BNY Mellon is a processing and services provider. It has almost no credit or interest-rate exposure.
    * Development Bank of Singapore
      * It is known as the Fort Knox of Asia
    * If we had a Latin motto in my family, it would be the Latin for work before play. Eat your vegetables, then you get dessert. Being on the board of Berkshire is a bit like getting dessert first: the chance to be with Warren and Charlie. The vegetables will come when they aren’t there, when the job of the board will be to protect this precious culture.

  * For many nations, the lack of independent refining capacity remains the bottleneck
  * China’s approach illustrates how long-term industrial strategy can outweigh reactive policy
