  * thoughts:
    * <WRAP>
> Some buyers will take their stake in an SPV and repackage it into another SPV that they will sell to additional investors. Further downstream, buyers can find themselves owning an interest in a vehicle that owns exposure to another vehicle, which in turn owns exposure to another vehicle that ultimately holds the desired company’s stock.
</WRAP> Sounds like SPVs are the new MBS.
    * Exclusivity sounds great until fraud shows up. Even Madoff investors were "invite" only until there was no one to hold the bag.
