    * Mark Spitznagel, who earned \$1 billion in a single day for his clients during 2015’s “Flash Crash.”
    * A protégé of “Black Swan” author Nassim Nicholas Taleb, his hedge fund, Universa Investments, also scored major gains when Lehman collapsed and when Covid-19 sparked a meltdown.
    * He wasn’t reading the tea leaves and predicting the timing of stock swoons
    * Universa buys so-called tail-risk protection that loses money most of the time and then pays off hugely if a downturn is particularly sharp
    * The reason Spitznagel thinks the current bull market’s comeuppance could be the worst since 1929 is repeated federal rescues of markets and the economy
