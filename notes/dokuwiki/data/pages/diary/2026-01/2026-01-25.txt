^ Business ^ Management ^ Price < Value ^ Price > Value ^
| Good | Good | Emphatic Buy | Admire, but don't buy |
| Good | Bad | Buy & hope for management change | Wait for management change |
| Bad | Good | Buy & hope that management does not change | Sell |
| Bad | Bad | Buy, hope for management change & pray company survives | Emphatic Sell |

highlights:
  * preponderance of publicly traded companies
  * good companies, good management and good investments
  * The best measure of corporate quality is a high excess return, i.e., a return on capital that is vastly higher than its cost of capital
  * In investing the comparison is between the value that you attach to a company, given its fundamentals and the price at which it trades.
  * the contrast between equity risk and operating risk - Operating risk reflects the risk of the businesses that you operate in, whereas equity risk reflects operating risk magnified by financial leverage; the former is measured with the cost of capital whereas the latter is captured in the cost of equity
