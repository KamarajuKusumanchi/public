  * A share of stock is ownership in a corporation.
  * Dividends are sums of money paid by a corporation to shareholders.

To compute yield, use

<code>
round((dividend / stock_price) * 100, 1)
</code>

For example
<code>
In [6]:
def yield_pct(dividend, stock_price):
    res = round((dividend / stock_price) * 100, 1)
    return res


In [7]:
dividend = 1.55; stock_price = 82.00

In [8]:
yield_pct(1.55, 82.00)
Out[8]:
1.9
</code>

So, if a company pays \$1.55 dividend and its stock price is \$82.00, then the yield is 1.9%

pg-5
  * profit yield = ((new_price / old_price) -1)
  * total yield = profit yield + dividend yield

pg-10
  * A dividend aristocrat is an S&P 500 company that has raised its dividend every year for the past 25 years.
  * A dividend achiever is an S&P 500 company that has raised its dividend every year for the past 10 years.
