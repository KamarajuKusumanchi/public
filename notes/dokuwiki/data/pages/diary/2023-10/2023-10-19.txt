Q. What is the difference between "https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean" and "https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome"

A.

| repo link | https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean | https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome |
| repo name | Bypass Paywalls Chrome Clean | Bypass Paywalls |

For brevity, let's call "Bypass Paywalls Chrome Clean" as BPC and "Bypass Paywalls" as BP.

Notes:
  * BPC is a fork of BP created by magnolia1234
  * BPC has some additional features
  * BPC is cleaner because it removes Google Analytics but BP has it and refused to remove it.

On 2023-10-18, I wanted to report that barrons.com is not working with https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome . But I could not. https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome/issues/new gave the following notice.
<code>
An owner of this repository has limited the ability to open an issue to users that have contributed to this repository in the past.
</code>

barrons.com worked out of the box with https://gitlab.com/magnolia1234/bypass-paywalls-chrome-clean .

Till now I was using BP. But decided to move to BPC going forward.
