  * Noam Shazeer
    * Google colleague, Daniel De Freitas
  * In 2017, Shazeer published a paper with seven other Google researchers called “Attention is All You Need,” detailing a computer system that could reliably predict the next word in a sequence when prompted by humans. It became the underpinning of the generative AI technology that followed.
  * Shazeer and De Freitas quit Google in 2021 to launch Character
  * “The Aarthi and Sriram Show” podcast
  * Google co-founder Sergey Brin played a key role in the deal to bring Shazeer back
