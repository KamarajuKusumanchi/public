Notes from https://www.quantamagazine.org/undergraduate-upends-a-40-year-old-data-science-conjecture-20250210/ - Undergraduate shows that searches within hash tables can be much faster
  * Andrew Krapivin
    * was an undergraduate at Rutgers University
    * now a graduate student at the University of Cambridge
    * came up with a potential way to further miniaturize the pointers so they consumed less memory
  * The “Tiny Pointers” paper
    * Martín Farach-Colton, a co-author of the “Tiny Pointers” paper
      * Krapivin’s former professor at Rutgers
      * now at New York University
    *  William Kuszmaul of Carnegie Mellon University, a co-author of the “Tiny Pointers” paper
  * Alex Conway of Cornell Tech in New York City
  * hash tables
    * date back to the early 1950s
    * Fullness of a hash table
  * Andrew Yao
    * https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3828.3836 - 1985 paper
    * https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/yao_1611524.cfm - won the A.M. Turing Award

Notes from https://scijinks.gov/pressure/ - Why Does the Atmosphere Not Drift off Into Space?
  * Mars
    * is less than half Earth’s size
    * is around one-tenth Earth’s mass.
    * Its atmosphere is only about 1/100th as dense as Earth’s.
    * Its atmosphere is mostly CO2.
  * Earth's atmosphere
    * Ninety-nine percent of the air is in the lowest 30 kilometers of the atmosphere.
    * about 14.7 pounds of air is pressing down on every square inch of our bodies
    * Even at 3,000 — 4,500 meters altitude, the air becomes thin enough that most people have trouble getting enough oxygen.
  * If Earth were the size of a beach ball, the breathable atmosphere would be as thin as paper.
