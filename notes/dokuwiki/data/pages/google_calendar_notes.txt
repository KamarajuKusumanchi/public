==== keyboard shortcuts ====
You can use keyboard shortcuts in Google calendar. It is a very useful feature. To enable it
  * Settings -> General -> Keyboard shortcuts -> Enable keyboard shortcuts -> check

Press question mark “?” to see some of them.

Shortcuts that I found useful
  * ctrl+s - to save an event
  * e - to edit an event
  * Esc - to return to calendar grid from an event details page

The full list can be seen in https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37034 .

==== dummy ====
  * When I edit a recurring event and save it, a window pops up with three options - ["This event", "This and following events", "All events"]. The default is "This event". Is there any way to change the default to "This and following events"?
