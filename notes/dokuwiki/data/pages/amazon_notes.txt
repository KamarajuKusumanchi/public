==== split payment on multiple cards ====
Situation: I have two \$25 "visa gift cards". My order total was \$75. I wanted to split the payment between three cards (two visa gift cards and my normal credit card). But Amazon does not allow to split payment across multiple cards.

Hack: Buy an Amazon gift card of the same value with each "visa gift card". I did this once for each card (one after another). After this my 'Amazon gift card' balance went to $50. Then I split the payment between my normal credit card and Amazon gift card balance.

==== links I came across ====
  * https://www.amazon.com/redeem - to redeem a gift card
  * https://amazon.com/reportascam - to report any suspicious communication — a call, text, or email — that you think may not be from Amazon.

==== cvv number of amazon prime chase visa credit card ====
The cvv number is located in the signature box towards right. It is a bit confusing because usually it is besides the signature box. But in the case of Amazon prime chase visa credit card, it is in the signature box itself.
