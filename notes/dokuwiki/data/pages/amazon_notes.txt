==== split payment on multiple cards ====
Situation: I have two \$25 "visa gift cards". My order total was \$75. I wanted to split the payment between three cards (two visa gift cards and my normal credit card). But Amazon does not allow to split payment across multiple cards.

Hack: Buy an Amazon gift card of the same value with each "visa gift card". I did this once for each card (one after another). After this my 'Amazon gift card' balance went to $50. Then I split the payment between my normal credit card and Amazon gift card balance.

==== links I came across ====

  * https://amazon.com/reportascam - to report any suspicious communication — a call, text, or email — that you think may not be from Amazon.
