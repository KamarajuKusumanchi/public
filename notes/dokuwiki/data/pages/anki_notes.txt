==== remove duplicate cards ====
I am using the "Remove Duplicate Cards" addon available at https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/95590040 .

To install it
<code>
start anki on the command line
-> Tools -> Add-ons
-> Get Add-ons
-> enter the code displayed on the addon page (ex:- 95590040)
</code>

Notes:<WRAP indent>
I have not found a way to do this directly on ankiweb.net. \\

==== advantage of debian anki package ====
  * The account on https://ankiweb.net/ can be synchronised with anki (installed on a Debian machine). The advantage of the Debian version is that you can delete the cards as needed. The online version does not support card deletion. I am currently using
<code>
% anki --version
anki 2.1.8

% dpkg -l anki | grep ^ii
ii  anki           2.1.8+dfsg-1 all          extensible flashcard learning program
</code>

==== AnkiDroid vs. Anki Desktop Vs. AnkiWeb ====
  * AnkiDroid is not affiliated with Anki Desktop or AnkiWeb. AnkiDroid is based on Anki Desktop but it is developed by an entirely separate community of volunteers.
