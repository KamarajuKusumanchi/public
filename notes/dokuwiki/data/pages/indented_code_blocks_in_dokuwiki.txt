For example
  Note that the order of redirections is significant. For example, the command
  <code>
  ls > dirlist 2>&1
  </code>
  directs both standard output (file descriptor 1) and standard error (file descriptor 2)
  to the file dirlist, while the command
  <code>
  ls 2>&1 > dirlist
  </code>
  directs only the standard output to file dirlist, because the standard error was made a
  copy of the standard output before the standard output was redirected to dirlist.
