==== news websites ====
  * https://www.statnews.com/
  * https://www.eenews.net/

==== food websites ====
  * https://www.eatingwell.com/ - avoid. See for example
    * https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7985928/is-sun-cooked-tomato-sauce-safe/ - very wordy, lot of links, low information density.

==== websites to avoid ====
  * https://www.pehalnews.in/
    * I came across https://www.pehalnews.in/why-one-asset-manager-avoided-ftx-before-the-storm-bitwise-qa/2625365/ which is supposed to be same as https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-19/why-one-asset-manager-avoided-ftx-before-the-storm-bitwise-q-a . But the former is a bit "garbled up" and not easy to follow. Avoid this website.
