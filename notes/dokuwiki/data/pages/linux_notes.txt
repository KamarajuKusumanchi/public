==== ls and mv ====
Sample command
<code>
ls -rt *.txt | tail -n5 | tr '\n' '\0' | xargs -0 -i% mv % x1
</code>

Notes:
  * Works even if there are spaces in the filenames. Compare this with <code>
mv `ls -rt *.txt | tail -n5` x1
</code> which will not work if there are spaces in the filenames.
  * Does not work if the filenames contain newline characters.

==== remove large directories ====

Use rsync to delete large directories.

<code>
mkdir empty_dir
rsync -a --delete empty_dir/    yourdirectory/
</code>

As per https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/37329/efficiently-delete-large-directory-containing-thousands-of-files, it is more efficient than running "rm -rf" or some combination of find + "rm -rf".

==== tput: unknown terminal "xterm-256color" ====
When I moved my miniconda3 installation from /home/rajulocal/miniconda3 to /opt/rajulocal/miniconda3, I started getting
<code>
tput: unknown terminal "xterm-256color"
</code>

To fix it, I did
<code>
conda install --force-reinstall ncurses
</code>

It turns out that the --fore-reinstall option was important since simply doing
<code>
conda install ncurses
</code>
was not installing ncurses as it was already uptodate.
