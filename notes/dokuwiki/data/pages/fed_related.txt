==== To be verified ====
1) In https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm , I see "FOMC Statement" and "FOMC Minutes". What is the difference between the two?

A) The FOMC releases the "FOMC statement" after each FOMC meeting.
The "FOMC Minutes" are released sometime later.
For example, the Fed announced new rates on Wed 2022-05-04 at 2 pm.
On 2022-05-05, I see the "statement" on the website but not the "minutes".
