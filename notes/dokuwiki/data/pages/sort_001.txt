==== clean amazon basics mouse wheel ====
I followed the instructions in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGrURf2ws14 .  I opened the mouse, cleaned the wheel shaft and assembly.  But when I put everything back, the left mouse button stopped working.  I am not sure what I did wrong.

I ended up buying Logitech precision pro mouse from Costco for $30. It is much better than the Amazonbasics mouse.

==== Vitamin C ====
  * Lack of vitamin C causes Scurvy.
  * While many animals produce their own vitamin C, humans and a few others do not.
    * The technical way of saying this is "humans are unable to metabolically synthesize vitamin C."
    * guinea pigs, monkeys - examples of mammals that cannot produce Vitamin C on their own.
  * Sources of vitamin C in the food
    * fruits: citrus fruits, amla, guava, kiwifruit, lemons, limes, oranges, papaya, strawberries
    * vegetables: red peppers, bell peppers, chili peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, parsley, brussel sprouts, cabbage, potatoes, spinach, watercress
  * Cooking often decreases vitamin C in foods.
  * Pasteurized milk does not have vitamin C
    * Commercial milk is pasteurized
    * Pasteurization is a heating process.
      * It makes milk safer for infants to drink.
      * But it also destroys Vitamin C.
      * So to get vitamin C, supplement the infant's diet with onion juice or cooked potato.

==== deficiency diseases ====
  * Scurvy, beriberi and pellagra - examples of diseases caused by micronutrient deficiencies
