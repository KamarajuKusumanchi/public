  * https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/calendar is pretty good . It  covers Fed's speeches. You can look at the historical trends by hovering the mouse over or by clicking into it. Better than finviz's economic calendar (https://finviz.com/calendar.ashx) but YMMV.

    * You can filter events by impact. The 3 star ones are "high impact"; 1 star ones are "low impact" etc.,
\\
  * To filter events by impact, use
    * High important events: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/calendar&importance=3
    * Medium important events: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/calendar&importance=2
    * Low important events: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/calendar&importance=1
  * The default one (https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/calendar) corresponds to the last one (importance = 1).
\\
  * You can also specify a range of dates. For example, to see all the high important events for June, you can do something like https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/calendar/all/2024-06-01/2024-06-30&importance=3
