  * https://github.com/cosmocode/csv/issues/29 - Add support to filter out comments
    * The original csv plugin does not support comments in the csv file. So I raised this issue.
  * https://github.com/cosmocode/csv/pull/30/files - my pull request to fix the above issue.
  * https://github.com/KamarajuKusumanchi/csv - my fork that adds support to filter out comments.
