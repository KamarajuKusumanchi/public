==== ignore subdirectories ====
One way is to call diff without the --recursive (-r) option and use grep to filter out the unwanted messages:

<code>
 % diff dir1 dir2 | grep -v "^Only in "
</code>
or
<code>
 % diff -q dir1 dir2 | grep -v "^Only in "
</code>

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30446490/diff-only-compare-files-and-ignore-subdirectories/ for some sample tests using this idea.

==== diff word by word ====
<code>
git diff --word-diff --no-index -- foo bar
</code>
or
<code>
git diff -U0 --word-diff --no-index -- foo bar
</code>

You can run this command even if the files are not part of a git repository.
