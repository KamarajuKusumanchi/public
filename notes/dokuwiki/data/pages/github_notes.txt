===== search issues =====
==== search issues filed by a user ====
For your own issues
<code>
https://github.com/issues
</code>

For other users, there are two possible approaches.

Solution 1:
<code>
https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+author%3Ausername+archived%3Afalse+
</code>

For example
<code>
https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+author%3AKamarajuKusumanchi+archived%3Afalse+
</code>

Solution 2:
<code>
is:issue is:open author:$author
</code>
for example
<code>
is:issue is:open author:kamarajukusumanchi
</code>
