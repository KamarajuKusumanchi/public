==== deindexing of inactive repos ====
Github will deindex a repo from search if there is no activity in it in the last one year.

This is a bit annoying to say the least. For example, I have some "matured" repos (ex:- https://github.com/KamarajuKusumanchi/.mycd) where I do not commit much but want them to be included in the search results.

Ref:
  * https://github.blog/changelog/2020-12-17-changes-to-code-search-indexing/ <code>
If the repository does not have any activity for an entire year, the repository will be purged from the Code Search index.
</code>

    * discusses some work arounds for this restriction.


===== searching code =====
==== search files with extension ====
<code>
foo path:*.extension
</code>

ex:-
<code>
foo path:*.ipynb
</code>

will search for ''foo'' in .ipynb files

Ref:- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59909592/how-can-i-search-all-files-ending-with-the-file-extension-feature-on-github

==== search in a particular file ====
Use
<code>
filename:.travis.yml
</code>
for example
<code>
python unittest filename:.travis.yml
</code>

==== exclude a repository from search results ====
Add
<code>
-repo:user_name/repo_name
</code>
to the search string.

Ref:
  * https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax#exclude-certain-results - documents the '-' operator.

==== exclude forks from search results ====
tags | do not search in forks

To exclude forks from your results:
<code>
NOT is:fork
</code>

To search only fork repositories:
<code>
is:fork
</code>

Example:
<code>
header_to_metadata_and_cell NOT is:fork
</code>
will search for header_to_metadata_and_cell in non-fork repositories.

On 2026-01-26, ''header_to_metadata_and_cell NOT is:fork'' gave 33 results vs 204 results for ''header_to_metadata_and_cell''

===== search issues =====
==== search issues filed by a user ====
For your own issues
<code>
https://github.com/issues
</code>

For other users, there are two possible approaches.

Solution 1:
<code>
https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+author%3Ausername+archived%3Afalse+
</code>

For example
<code>
https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+author%3AKamarajuKusumanchi+archived%3Afalse+
</code>

Solution 2:
<code>
is:issue is:open author:$author
</code>
for example
<code>
is:issue is:open author:kamarajukusumanchi
</code>
