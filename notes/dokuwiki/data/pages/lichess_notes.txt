==== get old icons in the new lichess app ====
today | 2026-01-16

The new app is using "Staunty" piece set. I believe the old app was using "Colin M.L. Burnett" piece set. To change it back

open app -> click on profile icon top left -> Settings -> Theme -> Piece set -> select "Colin M.L. Burnett"

==== follow someone via the app ====
On the sidebar go to Community -> Players -> click the search button -> enter the userid -> Follow -> drag to right

==== game types ====
  * It has bullet (1-3 mins), blitz (5 mins), rapid (10 mins), classical (15 mins). You can also create a game with your own timings if you want.
  * My favorite is 10+0 Rapid style.

==== analyze pgn ====
  * copy paste the contents of pgn into https://lichess.org/paste
  * I did not find a way to directly upload a pgn file to their server.

==== for kids ====
  * Enable the kid mode at https://lichess.org/account/kid . This will disable all site communications, communications from other internet users.

==== useful links ====
  * https://github.com/ornicar/lila - source code

==== questions to explore ====
  * The "analysis board" in the desktop version of lichess.org shows "Recommended puzzle training" and gives an opening name. How to access this feature in the android mobile app?
