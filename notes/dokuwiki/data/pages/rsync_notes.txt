==== top level separation ====
Situation:\\
I have a directory (say source/) with many sub directories and files under it (source/dir1, source/dir2, ... , source/file1, source/file2, ...). I want to copy it to two separate folders (say destA, destB). The first folder contains all the top level files (source/file1, source/file2 etc.,), the second folder contains the rest (source/dir1, source/dir2 etc., but not source/file1, or source/file2 etc.,).

Solution:
There are two approaches I can think of. Both work. I prefer the second one as it is a bit cleaner.

Approach1:
<code>
rsync -prltvzD -n --delete-after --exclude='/*/' source/ destA/
rsync -prltvzD -n --delete-after --include='/*/' --exclude='/*' source/ destB
</code>

Approach2:
<code>
rsync -prltvzD -n --delete-after --exclude='*/' source/ destA/
rsync -prltvzD -n --delete-after --include='*/' --exclude='/*' source/ destB
</code>

In both approaches, the destA and destB directories will be created on the fly if necessary.
