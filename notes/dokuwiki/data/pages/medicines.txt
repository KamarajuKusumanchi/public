==== nasal congestion ====
  * For nasal congestion, I recommend Sudafed. It contains pseudoephedrine which is effective against nasal congestion.
  * Do not buy "Sudafed PE" which contains a different drug called phenylephrine, which is not effective.
  * Sudafed is available OTC. But you have to ask a Pharmacist about it and show an ID to purchase. The purchase amounts are tracked.
