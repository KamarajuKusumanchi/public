  * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teacapps.barcodescanner - contains ads. See if you can find something that is functionally equivalent but ad free.

  * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobilityware.Sudoku
    * It is 40 MB which is a lot for a sudoku game.

    * It is 59 MB which is a lot for a sudoku game.
    * I did not find a 6x6 version

==== apps with too many ads ====
  * wordus by Ruby Game Studio
    * Tried it around 2022-02
    * Unpleasant experience.
    * I used it to play the wordle game. It was showing ads after each win and for each hint etc.,. It became so annoying that I decided to uninstall it in the end.

  * Word Collect - Word Games Fun by Super Lucky Games LLC
    * https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.platinumplayer.word.addict&hl=en_US&gl=US
    * Tried it around 2022-09
    * recommendation: no, avoid.
    * reason: shows too many ads. They come up whenever you go up one level. All the Ads are repetitive, annoying, uninteresting, unskippable.
