==== Car repair ====
  * I recommend McLaughlin's auto service. Low prices, quality work and good customer service.
  * 5-10 mins drive from PDJ.
  * [2021-07]: I went in to get the 30,000 mile service. The dealer would have charged ~\$1000. They charged ~\$300. The dealer would have done lot of unnecessary stuff but they only did whatever is necessary. For $300 they replaced air filter, cabin filter, rear brake pads, and changed oil. That includes labor as well.
  * [2021-06]: They charge only for repairs and not for inspection. Wow!\\ My car's dashboard was showing that the tires need to be inspected. They checked and confirmed that everything is good. They did not charge me a thing. Wow!
