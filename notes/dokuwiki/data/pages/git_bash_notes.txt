==== minimum recommended version ====
  * github recommends >= 2.29 for caching github credentials (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git). It is the first version offering OAuth support for GitHub.

==== links I came across ====
  * https://gitforwindows.org/
    * Is this same as getting 'git bash' terminal?

==== find out whether a terminal is cygwin or git bash ====
<code>
uname -s | cut -f 1 -d '-'
</code>

^ terminal ^ output ^
| git bash | MINGW64_NT |
| cygwin | CYGWIN_NT |
