==== Fidelity vs. Schwab ====
  * Fidelity offers true treasury autoroll with no time out of the market. Schwab keeps your money out of the market 1 week and gives no interest.
  * Fidelity will autoliquidate retail money market funds to settle withdrawals, ACH payments and security purchases. So you can keep money in a higher yielding money market fund instead of a settlement fund. Schwab does not offer this, and requires a manual sale of a money market fund.

==== linking a bank account ====
On 2023-07-xx, I tried to link CFCU checking account to Fidelity brokerage account in order to do an EFT (Electronic Funds Transfer). But I could not do it since Fidelity is asking for CFCU account's credentials. It is asking for this even when I chose "Enter my bank information on my own" instead of choosing "Log into my bank account with Plaid".

This issue seems to be specific to (Fidelity, CFCU). I was able to link accounts at other banks such as TD Bank, Capitalone to Fidelity without any issues.

I am not comfortable giving my bank account credentials to Fidelity.

Solution 1:
I called Fidelity the customer service. The representatives suggested to fill out a paper form, scan it and mail it to them. This form can be found as follows:

Login into fidelity.com ->  search for 'forms' in the top right 'Search or get a quote' bar -> click on 'Online Forms and Applications' -> All Forms -> pg-6 -> Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) -> Download the PDF

Solution 2:
Work around it by transferring money to a different bank (ex:- CFCU -> Capitalone -> Fidelity).

==== CMA vs regular brokerage ====
From https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=7555257#p7555257
>> The big difference is in how cash is handled - the CMA keeps your uninvested cash in FDIC insured bank accounts while the brokerage account puts it in money market funds that are covered by SIPC. Also, CMA accounts qualify for ATM fee reimbursement; with the brokerage account that's an optional perk depending on your account status. And the CMA has the Cash Manager feature that will let you pull cash from other accounts automatically when your CMA balance gets low, the brokerage account doesn't have that.
>> 
>> On the investing side, you can't trade on margin in the CMA.

==== qna ====
-----
:?: Can I buy treasuries in fidelity brokerage account?

:!: Yes, you can. There are positives and negatives between buying at TreasuryDirect vs. a brokerage account like Fidelity. TreasuryDirect allows you to buy in increments of \$100 vs. \$1,000 at Fidelity. You can sell them before maturity at Fidelity which is not possible in TreasuryDirect. More details at 
https://thefinancebuff.com/treasury-bills-cd-money-market.html . FWIW, I use Fidelity but I suggest you to go through the above link and decide yourself.

==== sweep in CMA account ====
  * From June 15, 2024, Fidelity CMA accounts will have an option to sweep to SPAXX
  * This was announced in the March 2024 statement of the Fidelity CMA account.
