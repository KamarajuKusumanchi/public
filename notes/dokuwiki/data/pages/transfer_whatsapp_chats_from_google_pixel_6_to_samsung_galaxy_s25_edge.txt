===== Transfer Whatsapp chats from Google Pixel 6 to Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge =====
==== Situation ====
today | 2025-12-30

I recently ported my number from Google Pixel 6 to Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. The OS of both phones is Android. The Whatsapp chats are still on the old phone. They are not backed up to any server.

==== Task ====
The task is to transfer them to the new phone. I want to transfer everything - all chats, media, photos etc.,

==== Solution ====
I asked Google Gemini and it gave detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do it. Below is a summary of what I did.

Setup
  * Connect both phones to a power source.
  * Turn on wifi on both the phones.

On Google Pixel 6
  * Settings -> Display & touch -> Screen timeout -> 30 minutes
  * Open Whatsapp -> Settings -> Chats -> Transfer chats -> Start
  * -> Allow Whatsapp to find, connect to, and determine the relative position of nearby devices -> Allow

On Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge
  * Install Whatsapp
  * Register with the same phone number
  * Scan QR code to connect phones -> Continue
  * Allow Whatsapp to find, connect to, and determine the relative position of nearby devices -> Allow

Then
  * Scan the QR code on the new phone with the old phone
  * On the new phone "allow" the old phone to be connected
  * Change the screen timeout on the old phone to its original value
    * Settings -> Display & touch -> Screen timeout -> 30 seconds
