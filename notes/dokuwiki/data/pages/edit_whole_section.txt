===== Edit a whole section =====
scope | dokuwiki

Say you have some subsections in a given section and want to edit some or all of them together. Put them all into a <nowiki><WRAP></nowiki> container. You will then get a single edit button at the very end.

For example, to edit the master section and subsections 1, 2, and 3 below, I did
<code>
<WRAP>
==== section 1 ====
I am in the first section.

==== section 2 ====
I am in the second section.

==== section 3 ====
I am in the third section.
</WRAP>
</code>

To edit subsections 4 and 5 below, I did
<code>
==== section 4 ====
<WRAP>
I am in the fourth section.

==== section 5 ====
I am in the fifth section.
</WRAP>
</code>

<WRAP>
==== section 1 ====
I am in the first section.

==== section 2 ====
I am in the second section.

==== section 3 ====
I am in the third section.
</WRAP>

==== section 4 ====
<WRAP>
I am in the fourth section.

==== section 5 ====
I am in the fifth section.
</WRAP>

==== section 6 ====
I am in the sixth section.
