==== Hamsini's bookmark ====
today | 2024-05-22

My daughter (Hamsini) accidentally designed what is probably the best bookmark I have come across. Here is how to do it.
  * Take a normal sheet of paper (ex:- letter sized)
  * fold it in half
  * cut small triangles at the corners

Why is it the best design?
  * The bookmark spans across the entire page. So you can open the book from the very right side.
  * Since we have cut small triangles at the end, it won't dog ear over time.
  * You can drag the bookmark down/up as you read a page. This way you can either cover what you are about to read or what you have already read.
  * If you find something interesting, you can note it down on the bookmark itself.
