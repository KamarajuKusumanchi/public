  * Silla Brush writes submarine articles for Blackrock. \\ See for example: <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/blackrock-s-sustainable-investment-funds-surge-to-509-billion?srnd=markets-vp</nowiki> . \\ Ignore articles written by him/her.

==== incomplete ====
  * John Liu, Claire Che, Dong Cao, and Coco Liu \\ See for example: <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-26/china-is-said-to-ask-didi-to-delist-from-u-s-on-security-fears?srnd=technology-vp</nowiki> . The article says "regulators want Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi to delist from the New York Stock Exchange because of concerns about leakage of sensitive data." But it does not tell how does listing a company on NYSE result in "leakage of sensitive data"? Ignore articles written by these people.

  * Katherine Burton at <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ABoPhmLIrpU/katherine-burton</nowiki> \\ See for example: <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/millennium-returns-15-billion-in-pursuit-of-longer-term-cash?srnd=markets-vp</nowiki> . It does not give a complete picture of what is going on and the finer details to make an informed conclusion. Ignore articles written by this person.

==== space filling journalism ====
  * Claire Ballentine at <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ATR8P7ZTClE/claire-ballentine</nowiki> \\ See for example: <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-15/will-interest-rates-on-savings-accounts-go-up-marcus-ally-bank-keep-levels-low</nowiki> . Very low information density.
  * Tasos Vossos at <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ATluWOJkzQs/tasos-vossos</nowiki> \\ See for example: <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-07/blackrock-alumni-want-to-shake-up-world-of-junk-debt-investing?srnd=markets-vp</nowiki> . The title mentions BlackRock Alumni but there were no names in the first 6 paragraphs of the article. Probably writes submarine articles. Ignore articles written by him.
  * Katherine Greifeld at <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AS35L0tDv_U/katherine-greifeld</nowiki> \\ See for example: <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/blackrock-alumni-have-a-new-gameplan-to-disrupt-junk-debt-etfs?srnd=markets-vp</nowiki> . The title mentions BlackRock, State Street Alums but there were no names listed anywhere in the article. Probably write submarine articles. Ignore articles from this author.
  * Josh Robinson at <nowiki>http://www.bloomberg.com/authors/APYZa-30CgQ/josh-robinson</nowiki> \\ Here is an example <nowiki>http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-30/economists-say-greece-will-cling-to-euro</nowiki> . The article talks about the results from a survey but fails to mention how the survey is conducted, how the participants were paid (if any), number of people who took the survey etc., I find this type of articles incomplete, misleading and utterly useless.
  * Jonathan D. Rockoff and Michael Rothfeld at <nowiki>http://www.wsj.com/articles/biggest-valeant-holder-plumbed-philidor-ties-1447202547</nowiki> \\ Basically they wrote 1000+ article which can be summed up in one sentence - "Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc., manager of Sequoia Fund Inc., and the biggest shareholder of Valeant is inquiring abut Ties between Valeant and Philidor". I find reading this type of articles a waste of time.
