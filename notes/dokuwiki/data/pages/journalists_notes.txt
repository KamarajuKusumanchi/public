  * Tasos Vossos at <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/ATluWOJkzQs/tasos-vossos</nowiki> \\ See for example: <nowiki>https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-07/blackrock-alumni-want-to-shake-up-world-of-junk-debt-investing?srnd=markets-vp</nowiki> . The title mentions BlackRock Alumni but there were no names in the first 6 paragraphs of the article. Probably writes submarine articles. Ignore articles written by him.
  * Josh Robinson at <nowiki>http://www.bloomberg.com/authors/APYZa-30CgQ/josh-robinson</nowiki> \\ Here is an example <nowiki>http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-30/economists-say-greece-will-cling-to-euro</nowiki> . The article talks about the results from a survey but fails to mention how the survey is conducted, how the participants were paid (if any), number of people who took the survey etc., I find this type of articles incomplete, misleading and utterly useless.
  * Jonathan D. Rockoff and Michael Rothfeld at <nowiki>http://www.wsj.com/articles/biggest-valeant-holder-plumbed-philidor-ties-1447202547</nowiki> \\ Basically they wrote 1000+ article which can be summed up in one sentence - "Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb Inc., manager of Sequoia Fund Inc., and the biggest shareholder of Valeant is inquiring abut Ties between Valeant and Philidor". I find reading this type of articles a waste of time.
