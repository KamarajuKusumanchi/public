I love Google's Gemini. It is just amazing. It saved me countless number of hours.

In the pre-gemini days, my workflow used to be like this:

I will be working on task 1 -> I get some question -> I search google for an answer -> go through one of the results -> I get another question -> search for it in google -> go through one of the results -> ....

The search stack used to become so high that some times I completely forget what I was initially doing.

Gemini solves that. It helps me to focus on a single task and gets it done.

Whenever I find a solution via Gemini, I write it down in my notes and add a tag called "@gemini". In the last two months, Gemini came in handy 50 times.


<code>
$ git grep -i "@gemini" 2025-07* 2025-08* | wc -l
50
