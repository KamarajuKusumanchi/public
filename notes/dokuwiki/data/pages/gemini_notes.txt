I love Google's Gemini. It is just amazing. It saved me countless number of hours.

In the pre-gemini days, my workflow used to be like this:

I will be working on task 1 -> I get some question -> I search google for an answer -> go through one of the results -> I get another question -> search for it in google -> go through one of the results -> ....

The search stack used to become so high that some times I completely forget what I was initially doing.

Gemini solves that. It helps me to focus on a single task and gets it done.

Whenever I find a solution via Gemini, I write it down in my notes and add a tag called "@gemini". In the last two months, Gemini came in handy 50 times.


<code>
$ git grep -i "@gemini" 2025-07* 2025-08* | wc -l
50
</code>

The AI tools are usually useless unless you already know the answer. It can help you "locate" the answer but you should know what the answer is ahead of the time.

For example, I was chatting with Gemini live and the conversation went like this.

Gemini: Fed increased the interest rates today.

Me: That is not correct... Fed decreased the interest rates today. Can you please check?

Gemini: I apologize. You are right. Fed decreased the interest rates.

Me. That is not correct... Fed increased the interest rates today. Can you please check?

Gemini: I apologize. You are right. Fed increased the interest rates.

I did this for 6-8 times and it apologized in all the instances and said I am right and kept changing the answer back and forth.
