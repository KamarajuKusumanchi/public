==== my suggestions ====
  * Do not hire movers by the hour. Always ask for a full quote.


==== movers I avoid ====
  * Suburban solutions - expensive; broke furniture\\ www.SuburbanSolutions.com

  * Van with a Man - asked for extra money before they start loading; apparently the quote they gave is to chuck items into the truck. If the items have to be placed nicely, I have to opt for a higher priced package.\\ Tommy mover; 888-668-3788

==== moving boxes ====
grocery stores, walmart, liquor stores, food stores, book stores, DSW, drug stores like CVS or Walgreens.
