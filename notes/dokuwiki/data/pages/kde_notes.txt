==== move window to next desktop ====
<code>
K Menu
-> search for "system settings" -> click on "System Settings"
-> Workspace -> Shortcuts
-> System Settings -> KWin
</code>

<code>
Switch to Next Desktop     -> Ctrl+Alt+Right
Window to Next Desktop     -> Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Right
Switch to Previous Desktop -> Ctrl+Alt+Left
Window to Previous Desktop -> Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left
</code>

Notes:

I am not sure whether to use

<code>
Switch to Next Desktop     -> Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Right
Window to Next Desktop     -> Ctrl+Alt+Right
Switch to Previous Desktop -> Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left
Window to Previous Desktop -> Ctrl+Alt+Left
</code>

or

<code>
Switch to Next Desktop     -> Ctrl+Alt+Right
Window to Next Desktop     -> Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Right
Switch to Previous Desktop -> Ctrl+Alt+Left
Window to Previous Desktop -> Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Left
</code>

Afterwards see which operation you do most and then assign Ctrl+Alt+<Right|Left> to that as it involves pressing less number of keys.
