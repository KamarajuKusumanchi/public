===== Sample scripts =====

==== pass through ====
Here is an example of a pass through shell script that calls a python program located in the same directory.

<code>
% cat myapp
#! /bin/zsh -f
DIR="$(dirname "$(which "$0")")"
$DIR/myapp.py "$@"
</code>

I use this approach a lot. The idea is that all the heavy lifting is done by a script written in an appropriate language and the shell script just calls that. This way if we decide to use a different language to implement the feature or call a different script altogether, the end user will not notice a change.

==== backup a directory ====
The idea here is to cd into a given directory and then backup a directory in it. The path names are hard coded to make things simple.
<code>
#! /usr/bin/env zsh
set -e
topdir=/home/rajulocal/notes
bdir=projects

cd ${topdir}

asof=`date +'%Y%m%d_%H%M%S'`
ofile=${bdir}_${asof}.txz
tar cJf ${ofile} ${bdir}
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    printf "backup stored in: ${topdir}/$ofile\n";
fi
</code>

Sample run:
<code>
% ~/bin/bkup_notes.sh
backup stored in: /home/rajulocal/notes/projects_20160103_224746.txz
</code>
