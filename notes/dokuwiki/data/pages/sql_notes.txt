==== show distinct and total counts ====
<code>
select count(distinct username) as distinct_cnt,
count(username) as total_cnt
from users
</code>

==== show duplicate values and their count ====
<code>
select username, email, count(*)
from users
group by username, email
having count(*) > 1
</code>

Here we use 'having' instead of 'where' because the former can filter on aggregate functions.
