  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_tax - Window tax was a property tax based on the number of windows in a house. It was a significant social, cultural, and architectural force in England, France, and Ireland during the 18th and 19th centuries.

  * "rc-alert -d T" will show release critical bugs in packages that are currently installed on a system but only those that affect the testing distribution. This is useful to figure out how many RC bugs my system will have if I were to upgrade from stable to testing (but without actually changing sources.list or downloading the packages etc.,)

  * The account on https://ankiweb.net/ can be synchronised with anki (installed on a Debian machine). The advantage of the Debian version is that you can delete the cards as needed. The online version does not support card deletion. I am currently using
<code>
% anki --version
anki 2.1.8

% dpkg -l anki | grep ^ii
ii  anki           2.1.8+dfsg-1 all          extensible flashcard learning program

  * Some real numbers $x$ have two infinite decimal representations. For example, the number 1 may be equally represented by 1.000... or as by 0.999... (where the infinite sequences of trailing 0's or 9's, respectively, are represented by "..."). Conventionally, the decimal representation without trailing 9's is preferred. \\ Ref:-
