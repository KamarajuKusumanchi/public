==== C++ ====
The code below demonstrates how you can return a pointer to a static variable and dereference it in another function.

<code>
[rajulocal@hogwarts]~/work/cpp% cat return_pointer_to_static_variable.cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int* foo()
{
    static int counter=0;
    counter++;
    return &counter;
}

void bar()
{
    for(int i=0; i< 10; i++)
    {
        int* n = foo();
        if (*n == 1)
            cout << "foo is called "<< *n << " time\n";
        else
            cout << "foo is called "<< *n << " times\n";
    }
}

int main()
{
    bar();
    return 0;
}
</code>

<code>
[rajulocal@hogwarts]~/work/cpp% g++ return_pointer_to_static_variable.cpp
[rajulocal@hogwarts]~/work/cpp% ./a.out
foo is called 1 time
foo is called 2 times
foo is called 3 times
foo is called 4 times
foo is called 5 times
foo is called 6 times
foo is called 7 times
foo is called 8 times
foo is called 9 times
foo is called 10 times
