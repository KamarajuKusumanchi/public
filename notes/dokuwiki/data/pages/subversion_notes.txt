==== filtering the log messages ====
svn log between two dates 
<code>
svn log -r {2017-09-01}:{2017-10-31} | less
</code>

svn log between two dates by a particular author
<code>
svn log -r {2017-09-01}:{2017-10-31} --search author_foo | less
</code>

svn log by a particular user in the last N commits
<code>
svn log --search author_foo -l N | less
</code>

==== Increase the context when doing svn diff ====
By default, svn diff shows three lines of context. To change it to 10
<code>
svn diff FILENAME --diff-cmd=diff -x -U10
</code>

See
<code>
svn help diff
</code>
for explanation of the arguments and generic use cases.

==== What files changed locally? ====
List files that changed locally

Most generic way
  * Using perl <WRAP>
<code>
=> svn st | perl -ne '{ next if /^\?/; if (/(\S+)$/) {print "$1\n";} }' | xargs -r ls -al --time-style="+%Y%m%d_%H%M"
</code>

The -r argument to xargs tells not to run the command if there are no arguments. Useful in the corner case where no files tracked by svn are modified.
</WRAP>

Other possible ways


  * Using grep and cut <WRAP>
<code>
=> svn st | grep -v '^?' | cut -c 9- | xargs -r ls -al --time-style="+%Y%m%d_%H%M"
</code>

This does not work if GREP_OPTIONS is set to display line numbers in the output of grep. In that case the filename may not start from 9th character.

See the perl version above which does not have this issue.
</WRAP>

  * Using grep and awk <WRAP>
<code>
=> svn st | grep -v '^?' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -r ls -al --time-style="+%Y%m%d_%H%M"
</code>

This does not work if the svn st output contains lines of the form
<code>
A  +    file.c
</code>
See the perl version above which does not have this problem.
</WRAP>

==== What changed in a version? ====
What files changed in a revision?

<code>
% svn diff --summarize -c r297
</code>

What changes were made in a revision?

<code>
% svn diff -c r297
</code>

To show the files changed in a revision as well as the commit message

<code>
% svn log --verbose -r316
</code>
