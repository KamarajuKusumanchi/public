==== investing in private companies ====
  * I prefer to invest in something that is already up and running + profitable instead of a new venture.
  * Think twice before investing in a partnership with others since
    * the investments are illiquid
    * there will be one alpha personality in the group who will try to take more than his fair share and then getting out will be a headache
    * it will progressively become more and more difficult if you are not hands on in the day-to-day operations
