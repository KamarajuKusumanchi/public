==== edit files mapped via samba ====
When Samba mapping is used to edit files on a windows machines that were originally stored on Linux machine, I faced the following problems.

  * The executable bit is not set correctly. So, whenever a script is edited and saved on windows, I have to manually "chmod +x" it on Linux machine.
  * If a softlink is edited and saved on windows, the changes do not propagate to the original file. Instead, it creates a totally new file with the softlink's name.

Additional notes :

==== Terminal emulators in Windows ====

As of 2015-03-30, I am using Superputty. But here is a list of many terminal emulators I tried before converging onto Superputty.

[[http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html|putty]]
  * pros: very powerful, sessions can be stored, automated login by SSH key authentication
  * cons: no builtin xserver, can't have more than one terminal in a window. So if you want to connect to multiple machines, you have to open multiple putty sessions

[[https://github.com/jimradford/superputty/releases/|superputty]]
  * Pros:
    * different putty windows can be placed in a single window
    * can import putty sessions
    * Upon restart all previous sessions are automatically restored.
    * Very easy to run a single command across all the putty connections made via superputty
    * Saving new layouts is easy. Restoring a saved layout is just a double click away.

  * Cons:
    * Has some bugs - Alt+tab and user defined key board shortcuts (ex:- ctrl+left, ctrl+right to do tab switching) etc., stop working all of a sudden. However, this Bug is unreproducible and only happens some of the times.

[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/puttymanager/|putty manager]]
  * Pros:
    * Can have multiple putty windows in the same window

  * Cons:
    * Development seems to be stalled. Latest release 0.2.16 dates back to 2012-12-10
    * After closing a session with two tabs containing different putty connections, if I try to restore it, the result is two putty sessions in the same window but one below the other. That is the program does not restore the layout of tabs correctly.

[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/windowsconsole/|Alternative Windows Console]]
  * Pros:
    * Can have multiple putty windows in the same window

  * Cons:
    * Development seems to be stalled. Latest release 2.0.38 dates back to 2013-08-13
    * After closing a session with two tabs containing different putty connections, if I try to restore it, the result is two putty sessions in the same window but one below the other. That is the program does not restore the layout of tabs correctly. Moreover, in each putty window of the new session, the putty configuration dialog is displayed instead of automatically logging in to the machine.

[[http://ttyplus.com/multi-tabbed-putty/|mtputty]]
  * Pros:
    * Can have multiple putty windows in the same window

  * Cons:
    * If a session with multiple tabs is closed, it is not automatically restored.

==== conemu vs console2 ====
