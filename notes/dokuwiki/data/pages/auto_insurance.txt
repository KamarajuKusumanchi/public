  * Progressive gave me a quote of \$340 to insure my car on 2024-08-01. But when I checked it on 2024-08-04, the quote went up to \$360. I called the customer service about it. They told me that the quote is good only for 24 hours and can change over time. I found this behavior a bit disturbing. So I decided not to purchase from them.
