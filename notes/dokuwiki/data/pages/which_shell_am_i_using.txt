==== Which shell am I using? ====
Q. Which shell am I using?

A. There are two ways

<code>
% echo $0
/usr/bin/zsh

% ps -p $$
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
29189 pts/1    00:00:00 zsh
</code>

If necessary, the last command can be parsed as follows.
<code>
% ps -hp $$|awk '{print $5}'
/usr/bin/zsh
</code>
