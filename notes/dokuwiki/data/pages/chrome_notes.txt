===== favorite configuration on desktop =====
==== background of the inactive chrome tabs ====
If the background of the inactive chrome tabs is dark, their titles are not readily visible. To work around this, change the "theme color" to "Warm grey".

  chrome://settings/manageProfile -> Pick a theme color -> choose "Warm grey" option.

Before:

{{:chrome_tabs_dark_background.png}}

After:

{{:chrome_tabs_warm_grey_theme.png}}

==== set all websites to dark mode ====

<nowiki>chrome://flags/</nowiki> -> enable “Auto Dark Mode for Web Contents”

found it in | https://frugalprofessor.com/financial-update-oct-2024/

tags | experiments

==== open a pdf file directly without explicitly downloading it ====
<nowiki>chrome://settings/downloads</nowiki> (you can also go there via <nowiki>chrome://settings</nowiki> -> Downloads) -> "Ask where to save each file before downloading" -> turn it off

Once you download a pdf -> click on the download icon -> right click on the pdf file -> Always open with system viewer -> check

===== tips =====

==== switch to tab ====
tags | command line shortcut to "switch to this tab"

To switch to a pre-existing tab from the list of suggestions, use ↓ to select the correct suggestion -> tab -> enter.

You can also do (tab -> space) instead of (tab -> enter).

Related: ctrl+shift+a opens a "Search Tabs" dialogue where you can start typing and your query is matched against the list of currently open tabs. Note that this shortcut may not work on all websites. For example, on Google Docs it gets captured by the web page itself.
