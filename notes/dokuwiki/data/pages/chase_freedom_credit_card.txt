==== chase freedom credit card ====
If you have a “Chase freedom: ultimate rewards” credit card, consider upgrading
to “Chase freedom unlimited rewards” instead.

Both cards look the same, have the same APR, same foreign currency transaction fee, no annual fee etc., but the latter gives more rewards and you do not have to activate bonus categories every quarter.
