  * json does not allow multiline strings. You can
    - use "\\n" instead.\\ See:- http:%%//%%stackoverflow.com/questions/2392766/multiline-strings-in-json
    - put each line into different elements of an array.
See:- https://gitlab.com/d3k2mk7/public/blob/master/health/tds.json

FIXME:- The above statement should align with the bullet point.

  * json does not allow comments. But you can have a designated data element called "_comment" (or something) and put your comments there. <code>
{
  "_comment": "comment text goes here...",
  "foo": bar
}
</code>
