> I discovered that our taxable account at Vanguard had been slowly pilfered of approximately $100,000.00 in stocks transferred by ACATS to 2 different brokerage accounts that were not mine over a period of time.
>
> These stock transfers were taken out of our account each time we received a dividend beginning in May 2024.
> ...
> Every few months 750 shares of that fund were transferred to either Fidelity or Interactive Brokers. Transfers were made 3 times before I realized it was happening.
