  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_salt - History of salt
    * Salt's ability to preserve food was a founding contributor to the development of civilization. It helped eliminate dependence on seasonal availability of food, and made it possible to transport food over large distances.
    * However, salt was often difficult to obtain, so it was a highly valued trade item, and was considered a form of currency by many societies, including Rome.
    * According to Pliny the Elder, Roman soldiers were paid in salt, from which the word salary is derived, although this is disputed by historians.

The current measles outbreak is very sad. Scientists developed measles vaccine in 1963 and then MMR vaccine in 1971. These are proven very safe, effective. I don't understand why people don't take the vaccines. Now we have articles such as 

https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/measles-treatment-vaccine-infection-numbers-c8327637?mod=hp_listb_pos2 - The Race to Find a Measles Treatment as Infections Surge

Part of me thinks these biotechs that try to develop new treatment do not want people to believe in vaccines.

The MMR vaccine is just extraordinary. It has been so effective at preventing widespread disease and its devastating consequences that people today often don't remember or even know how dangerous these viruses once were.
