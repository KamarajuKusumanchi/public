Here is my recent travel experience:

Onward journey: \\
Travel date: 12/5/2021 - 12/6/2021 \\
Route: JFK -> New Delhi -> Vijayawada \\
Airlines: Air India (for all the flights including New Delhi to Vijayawada)
  * Air suvidha, rtpcr report, vaccination record - one hard copy was collected at the destination (Vijayawada).
  * In all other places (JFK, New Delhi), I just had to show the documents. They did not collect them.
  * I carried hard copeis. But had soft copies as a backup.
  * Print air suvidha in color (only on one side of the paper).
  * For the RTPCR test, it is 72 hours before departure (not arrival).
  * Luggage is only checked in till New Delhi.
  * I had to collect them and recheckin at New Delhi.
  * Customs, immigration, luggage transfer etc., took 3+ hours in New Delhi.
