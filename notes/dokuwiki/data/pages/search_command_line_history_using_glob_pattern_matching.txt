==== Task ====
The goal here is to quickly search the command line history using glob pattern matching.

==== Situation ====
When reverse searching the command line history using ctrl-r, a lot of characters have to be typed before arriving at the correct command. For example, to go to "cd ~/work/gitlab/rutils", one approach is to

<WRAP indent>
<code>
ctrl-r
cd<space>
</code>
</WRAP>
and keep hitting ctrl-r until arriving at
<WRAP indent>
<code>
cd ~/work/gitlab/rutils
</code>
</WRAP>

Another approach is to
<WRAP indent>
<code>
ctrl-r
cd ~/work/gitlab/r
<enter>
</code>
</WRAP>

Here almost the entire command had to be typed since the user did many "cd ~/work/gitlab/xxx" type of commands after doing "cd ~/work/gitlab/rutils".

Ideally, we want to avoid all this typing and get to the final command by typing a few keywords - say cd, rutils.

==== Solution ====
Add the following lines to ~/.zshrc.
<WRAP indent>
<code>
# Use glob patterns when using ctrl-r
#   ctrl-r wordA*wordB
# will match commands where wordA is followed by wordB with zero or more number
# of characters in between. This functionality is not available in old zsh
# versions (ex:- 4.2.6) so check for its availability.
zle -al | grep -q history-incremental-pattern-search-backward
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  bindkey "\C-r" history-incremental-pattern-search-backward
fi
</code>
</WRAP>

After this
<WRAP indent>
<code>
ctrl-r
cd*rutils
</code>
</WRAP>
will match commands where cd is followed by rutils.

==== System Information ====
Tested this tip using zsh 5.0.7 on a machine running Debian Jessie.

<WRAP indent>
<code>
% dpkg -l zsh | grep ^ii
ii  zsh            5.0.7-5      amd64        shell with lots of features
</code>
</WRAP>
