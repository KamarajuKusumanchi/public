==== print column foo when column bar is empty ====

In a big csv file, say there are two columns of interest - foo and bar. The idea here is to print foo entries whenever bar is empty.

Get the column numbers of foo and bar.

<code>
=> head -n 1 data.csv | tr ',' '\n' | cat -n | grep -E "\<foo\>|\<bar\>"
     7  foo
    81  bar
</code>

which shows that foo is in 7th column, bar is in 81st column. Now use awk to quickly get a list of foo entries with empty bar

<code>
=> cut -f 7,81 -d ',' data.csv | awk -F "," '{if ($2 == "") print $1}' | sort | uniq
</code>

==== print lines that have Y in the 15th field ====
Assumption: fields are separated by "|"

<code>
awk -F "|" '$15 == "Y"' file.txt
</code>

<code>
awk -F "|" '{if ($15 == "Y") print}' file.txt
</code>

==== count the number of columns ====
Assumption: fields are delimited by "|"

<code>
awk -F "|" "{print NF; exit}" file.txt
</code>
