These I-bonds seem  like an interesting product: ~7% interest rate (but changes every 6 months); inflation protected; $10k investment limit per yer per ssn; only federal tax; no state tax; 1 year lockup; 3 month interest loss if withdrawn before 5 years.

It seems like a good ROI with diversification benefits when mixed with other popular options like stocks, real estate.

If the inflation goes up, the yield will go up and vice versa.

The interstate rate has two components - fixed and inflation related. They are calling the total interest rate "composite".

Here is the example: https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm#rate

The same page also has historical interest rates at the bottom (https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds_iratesandterms.htm#compositerate). Since 1998, it was always above 7%.

To buy them we have to open an account on treasurydirect.gov and buy it from there.
