===== Remove lines with duplicate letters =====
==== Task ====
Find five letter words that are made up of letters {h, i, k, e, r, s} where each letter appears only once.
==== Issue ====
<code>
grep -i "^[hikers][hikers][hikers][hikers][hikers]$" /usr/share/dict/american-english
</code>
gives
<code>
Essie
Hesse
Irish
Kerri
Reese
Sheri
...
</code>
where some letters are duplicated in some of the words. For example, the letter 'i' appears twice in the word 'Irish'. We need to filter out all such words.

==== Solution ====
Pipe the output to ''grep -viE '(.).*\1' ''. For example

<code>
% grep -i "^[hikers][hikers][hikers][hikers][hikers]$" /usr/share/dict/american-english | grep -viE "(.).*\1"
Sheri
Shrek
heirs
hiker
hikes
hires
sheik
shire
shirk
skier
</code>
