==== copying keys ====
When setting up password less authentication via ssh, use ssh-copy-id to copy the public key to the remote machine.

The command looks like
<code>
ssh-copy-id user@host
</code>
When you run it the first time, it will ask for password and then copies the key to the remote machine. It is very convenient!
