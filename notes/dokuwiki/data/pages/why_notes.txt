==== features missing in dokuwiki ====
  * sections are not numbered
    * [today | 2023-05-01] filed a bug for this - https://github.com/dokuwiki/dokuwiki/issues/3531 . But there is no interest. There were some suggestions in the thread. But they either do not work right out of the box or are not robust enough for complex scenarios or require changing content of existing pages etc.,
  * Rearranging sections from one part of the document to another (especially in large pages) is not easy. A simple drag and drop to rearrange sections would be nice.
