==== apt-cache search with tags ====
Use axi-cache instead of apt-cache
<code>
axi-cache search term tag
</code>
For example
<code>
 % axi-cache search scanner suite::kde
2 results found.
Results 1-2:
100% skanlite - image scanner based on the KSane backend
68% skanlite:i386 - image scanner based on the KSane backend
More terms: ksane skanlite backend image based attached scanning
More tags: hardware::scanner works-with-format::png works-with-format::jpg use::scanning works-with::image:raster works-with::image scope::application
</code>

If we are using apt-cache, it would not be possible to "discover" skanlite unless we know the right set of keywords. For example, searching for 'scanner' and 'kde' would not have told us about skanlite package.
<code>
 % apt-cache search scanner kde
clamtk - graphical front-end for ClamAV
libkf5sane-data - scanner library (data files)
libkf5sane-dev - scanner library development headers
libkf5sane5 - scanner library (runtime)
</code>
