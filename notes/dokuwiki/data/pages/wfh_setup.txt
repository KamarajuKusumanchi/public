==== Things I tried but did not like ====
^ item ^ details ^ review ^ recommendation ^
| Mouse | AmazonBasics Wireless Computer Mouse with USB Nano Receiver \\ Purchased: 2015-07 \\ https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005EJH6Z4/ | It is a bit small. \\ Worked well initially. \\ But after a while, the scroll wheel became sluggish as it gathered dust. | No.|
| Chair | Maxchief Upholstered Padded Folding Chair from Costco | Not comfortable especially if you have to use it for many hours during a day. \\ Mesh is scratchy and hard. | No.|
