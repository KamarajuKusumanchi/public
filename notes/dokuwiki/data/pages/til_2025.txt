TIL, a **proportional font** is a typeface where each character's width varies. For example, a wide letter like 'W' takes up more space than a narrow letter like 'i'. This is the opposite of a **monospace font**, where every character, including a 'W' and an 'i', occupies the exact same amount of horizontal space.

Most of the fonts you read in books and on websites are proportional because the varied spacing is considered easier to read and more visually appealing.  Monospace fonts are commonly used for things like computer code, where the uniform spacing helps with alignment and readability.

  * The “911” emergency number was introduced in the US in 1968.
  * The system was developed by AT&T. They chose 911 for three reasons:
    * First, it’s short and easy to dial on a rotary phone. For example, dialing 999 would take longer compared to dialing 911.
    * Second, the number 9 was not yet used as an extension.
    * Third, the company had already developed numbers like 411, allowing them to use the same basic infrastructure to process and route 911.

    * In 1628, William Harvey provided the first full and accurate description of blood circulation in the human body . But many people doubted his theory because he was not able to find the means by which blood passed from the arterial to the venous system. It was Marcello Malpighi that discovered the "missing link" in 1661. Using the newly invented microscope, he discovered the network of tiny capillaries that are 10 times thinner than human hairs and link arteries and veins.
