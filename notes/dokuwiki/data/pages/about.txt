==== about the wiki ====
  * This wiki is my brain dump.
  * I use it to reduce cognitive load and help my future self.
  * It is not an attempt to inform or educate others.
  * Contents are backed up from time to time to [[https://github.com/KamarajuKusumanchi/public/tree/master/notes/dokuwiki/data/pages|a github repo]]
  * Use that to report any issues.
  * I aim for zero typos, zero errors, and zero broken links.
  * Feedback/suggestions/comments are welcome (no matter how small or relevant you think they are). You can reach me at kamaraju at gmail dot com.
  * It's fine to reproduce or translate pages from this website, no need to ask permission, but please include my name and a link to the original page.
