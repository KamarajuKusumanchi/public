  * Use date +'%-M' to get the current minute without a leading zero (ex:- 8 instead of 08). Compare this with date +'%M' which pads it by 0 (ex:- 08 instead of 8).

Ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/79371/removing-leading-zeros-from-date-output

Use case: In https://github.com/KamarajuKusumanchi/.mycd/blob/master/mycd.sh, I needed a way to check if the current minute is in a given range. If the current minute is padded with zero then bash is interpreting it as an octal number which leads to problems if the current minute happens to be 08 which is not a valid octal number.
