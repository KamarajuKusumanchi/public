===== How to =====
==== start a new instance of notepad++ ====
  * Press Alt + F6 in an existing Notepad++ window.

==== insert current date and time ====
  * Edit -> Insert -> choose one of [Date Time (short), Date Time (long), Date Time (customized)].

Notes:
  * The Insert option in the Edit menu was not there in v8.1.1 . But it is there in v8.8.5 . So it must have been added somewhere in between.
