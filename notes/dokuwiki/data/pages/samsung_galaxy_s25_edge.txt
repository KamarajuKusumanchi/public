==== Zelle ====
I was using Zelle in Capitalone account. When I switched the phones, it stopped working. When someone tried to send me money, it was showing "pending status" to them. I got a text message asking me to enroll in Zelle. Re enrolling again fixed the issue.

Steps to re enroll: Capital one app -> click on the account -> Send money with Zelle -> settings/profile icon on top right -> Edit Zelle settings -> Add the phone number.

==== transfer Google Authenticator codes from Google Pixel 6 to Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge ====
tags | github 2 factor authentication

On the old phone:
  * Google Authenticator app -> hamburger icon -> Transfer codes -> Export codes
  * -> Select the codes you want to migrate.\\ In my case Github: KamarajuKusumanchi
  * -> A QR code will appear

On the new phone:
  * Google Authenticator app -> hamburger icon -> Transfer codes -> Import codes
  * -> Scan the QR code on the old phone

Post migration checks:
  * Open the Google Authenticator app on both phones. The 6-digit codes for the GitHub account should be identical and refresh at the same time on both devices.
  * Go to github.com on a computer, log out, and then log back in. When prompted for the 2FA code, use the one generated by the new phone.

==== stop the STOP hints ====
The Google Messages app writes STOP even though I have not typed any such thing. It is a bit confusing since when I look at the messages, I immediately think that I sent the STOP message. To disable it, I tried

Open the Google Messages app -> profile icon -> Messages settings -> Suggestions -> Smart Reply -> turn it off

Open the Google Messages app -> profile icon -> Messages settings -> Suggestions -> Actions -> Suggested actions -> turn it off

Open the Google Messages app -> profile icon -> Messages settings -> Gemini in Messages -> Show Gemini button -> turn it off

But the stop button is still there.

I cleared the cache using

Settings -> Apps -> Messages

--> Force stop -> OK

--> Storage -> Clear cache

and then restarted the app. But the stop button is still there.

Settings -> Notifications -> Advanced settings -> Suggest actions and replies for notifications -> turn it off

But the stop button is still there.

Someone asked about this on reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1n3r64o/how_do_i_remove_the_stop_button_from_automated/ but there was no solution posted (asof | 2026-01-25).
