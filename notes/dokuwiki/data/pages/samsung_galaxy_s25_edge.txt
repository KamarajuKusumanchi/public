==== Zelle ====
I was using Zelle in Capitalone account. When I switched the phones, it stopped working. When someone tried to send me money, it was showing "pending status" to them. I got a text message asking me to enroll in Zelle. Re enrolling again fixed the issue.

Steps to re enroll: Capital one app -> click on the account -> Send money with Zelle -> settings/profile icon on top right -> Edit Zelle settings -> Add the phone number.

==== transfer Google Authenticator codes from Google Pixel 6 to Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge ====
tags | github 2 factor authentication

On the old phone:
  * Google Authenticator app -> hamburger icon -> Transfer codes -> Export codes
  * -> Select the codes you want to migrate.\\ In my case Github: KamarajuKusumanchi
  * -> A QR code will appear

On the new phone:
  * Google Authenticator app -> hamburger icon -> Transfer codes -> Import codes
  * -> Scan the QR code on the old phone

Post migration checks:
  * Open the Google Authenticator app on both phones. The 6-digit codes for the GitHub account should be identical and refresh at the same time on both devices.
  * Go to github.com on a computer, log out, and then log back in. When prompted for the 2FA code, use the one generated by the new phone.
