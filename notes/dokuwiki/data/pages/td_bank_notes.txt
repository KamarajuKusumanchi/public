Taking the money out of the bank is a pain.
  * ACH push to a different bank takes 3 business days.
  * Transfer limits from TD Bank checking
    * per transfer - $2,500
    * daily - $3,000
    * rolling 30-day limit - $5,000
  * Transfer limits from TD Bank savings
    * per transfer - $2,500
    * daily - $3,000
    * rolling 30-day limit - $5,000

From the customer service reps -> tech department:
  * It is not possible to override these limits.
  * TD bank uses Fiserv to do the external transfers.
  * Fiserv is not same as ACH.
  * You cannot do ACH transfers from their website.

Depositing money into the account is also painful.
  * Deposited a check on 7/20 (Thu). It was pending asof 7/27 (Thu) and got cleared on 7/28 (Fri). Apparently, they hold the funds for 6 business days.
  * Compare this with Capitalone where it takes 1-2 business days for the funds to be fully available. Deposited a check on 7/17 (Mon) and it was fully available on 7/19 (Wed).
