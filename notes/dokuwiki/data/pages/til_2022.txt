  * https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.merge_asof.html - similar to a left-join except that we match on nearest key rather than equal keys. It is useful for "projecting" low frequency data onto high frequency. For example, a company might release earnings only 4 times a year. But using this function, you can get the "latest" earnings as of a given date.

??? Do we have to pay capital gains taxes on unrealized gains (or losses) on emini futures?
!!! Yes. The emini futures is a "1256 contract". If a contract is a "1256 contract" then it is treated as sold for its fair market value on the last business day of the year for tax purposes. So you have to pay capital gains tax on the emini futures regardless of whether the gains (or losses) are realized or unrealized.

  * In 2000, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established an online registry for the details of clinical trials. The FDA required that scientists who were studying therapies for serious diseases needed to provide some details of their study designs and the outcomes that they planned to investigate. This requirement reduced the bias towards positive findings in published research. We see evidence of this in the chart, showing clinical trials funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), which adopted this requirement. Before 2000 – when pre-registration of studies was not required – most candidate drugs to treat or prevent cardiovascular disease showed large benefits. But most trials published after 2000 showed no benefit. \\ https://ourworldindata.org/randomized-controlled-trials#preregistration-allows-us-to-hold-researchers-accountable-to-their-original-study-plans
