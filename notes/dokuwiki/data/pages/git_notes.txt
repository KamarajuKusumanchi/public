==== Updating feature branch with the latest development branch ====
tags | bring feature branch up to date with development branch

Situation 1:
  * User 1 raised a merge request to merge feature1 to development branch
  * Before the merge request is accepted, development branch is updated by User 2

Situation 2:
  * Say you forked from development branch a while ago to work on a feature and created a branch called "feature1".
  * After a while, development branch might have progressed and may have new changes added to it.

Task:
  * Bring the feature1 branch up to date with the latest development branch.

Solution:

Get the latest versions of development and feature branches in the local repository.
<code>
git checkout development
git pull
git checkout feature1
git pull
</code> 

Merge development branch into the feature branch and resolve any conflicts that may arise.
<code>
git merge development
</code> 
Push the changes to the remote.
<code>
git push
</code> 

Note:- The "git merge development" command works even if you have local changes not committed to feature1.
