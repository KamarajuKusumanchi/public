===== Plugins =====
==== NrrwRgn ====
A Narrow Region Plugin for vim (like Emacs Narrow Region). The development version is at https://github.com/chrisbra/NrrwRgn . The stable version can be found at http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3075.

Using the stable version 32, I encountered some problems with highlighting - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/vim_use/WFheSJa8_Wo (Last checked 2014-12-21). The issue is present even in the development version but I am unable to reproduce it (last checked 2015-01-24). It is suggested to upgrade to vim 7.4 in order to use the dev version.

==== Preprocess files before diffing them ====

==== print full file name ====

  * :echo expand("%:p")
  * :!ls %:p
  * :!realpath % - be aware that realpath is not POSIX
  * :!echo "$PWD/%" - very difficult to type this!
  * 1 followed by ctrl-g - shows full path name but does not expand "~" to home directory
  * :'<,'>!realpath % - to replace the current selection with the file path
  * set statusline+=%F - will show full filename in the status bar
  * ctrl-g - shows file path relative to vim's current working directory

Ref:- http://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/104/how-can-i-see-the-full-path-of-the-current-file

==== input control characters ====
Use ^Vnnn where nnn is the character value and 0 <= nnn <= 255. For example, ctrl-v65 will give A. For more details see http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Entering_special_characters
