==== links I came across ====
  * repo of yfinance - https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance

==== alternatives ====
  * yahooquery
  * yahoofinancials - the biggest difference from yfinance is that all the downloaded data is returned as JSON
  * yahoo_earnings_calendar - a small library to download the earnings calendar.
