==== consumer spending ====
  * "Consumer spending" is same as "personal consumption expenditures (PCE)"
  * I found three data sources for this:
    * https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEC96 - Real Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCEC96)
      * real = inflation-adjusted
      * published monthly
    * https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCE - Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)
      * published monthly
    * https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-spending
      * published every quarter
      * Is there a way to recon this with BLS or FRED data?
      * data is not matching with either https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEC96 or https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCE
  * Is consumer spending same as consumer discretionary spending? What is the difference?

  * https://maps.semcog.org/EconomicDashboard/chart/bc_per_cons.html
    * Tells that https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PCEC96 is what we should look at.
    * Consumer spending is broken into three categories
      * durable goods
        * have an average useful life of at least 3 years (e.g. motor vehicles)
      * nondurable goods
        * have an average useful life of less than 3 years (e.g. food)
      * services
        * commodities that cannot be stored or inventoried and are consumed at the time of purchase (e.g., dining out)
