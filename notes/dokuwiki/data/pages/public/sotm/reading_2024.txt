  * Pipeline stocks
    * Alerian MLP
  * U.S. pipeline infrastructure is largely built out and it’s hard to get regulatory and environmental approval for new construction. That’s favorable for pipeline operators.
  * The industry is divided into partnerships like Enterprise Products Partners and Energy Transfer and corporations like Kinder Morgan , Williams Cos. , and Oneok . Many investors favor the corporations because they prefer simpler 1099 tax forms to K-1s. 
  * Enterprise Products yields 7.6%, Energy Transfer pays out 9%, while Kinder Morgan and Williams offer yield in the 5% to 6% range.
  * Some investors prefer Williams due to its natural gas focus, given that long-term U.S. gas demand is probably better than oil.
  * TMUS
    * plans to return \$60 billion to shareholders in dividends and buybacks from 2023 through 2025. Its current market value is \$189 billion

Notes from https://www.barrons.com/amp/articles/live-longer-healthier-new-year-resolution-28f8b434 - 7 Things to Do in the New Year for a Longer, Healthier Life
  * Exercise regularly. Eat healthy. Drink moderately, if at all, and don’t smoke. Get enough sleep. Maintain strong relationships. Challenge your brain. Manage stress.
  * Dr. Peter Attia, in his book Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity
  * Schimpff, in his book Longevity Decoded: The 7 Keys to Healthy Aging
  * healthy diet, regular exercise, healthy weight, no smoking, and moderate alcohol intake
  * Exercise helps prevent heart disease; it helps ward off depression and dementia; it even helps prevent cancer by revving up our immune system.
  * Cardiorespiratory fitness
  * The best way of testing cardiorespiratory fitness is the VO2max test, which measures the maximum amount of oxygen your body can consume during vigorous exercise.
  * Exercise at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week
  * To maximize your fitness, include some interval training into your exercise regimen. Once a week, do 4×4 interval training: four intervals of intense exercise lasting four minutes apiece, separated by rest between each interval.
  * do full-body, multi-joint movements such as squats, dead lifts, and overhead presses that stress your hips, spine, and shoulders. 
  * Weightlifting—along with diet—is also key for avoiding osteoporosis.
  * People who have atrial fibrillation, or AFib, should avoid drinking. Even moderate drinking can bring on episodes, and AFib increases the likelihood of stroke.
  * Mediterranean diet - whole grains, vegetables, fruit, legumes, nuts, and fish is healthy.
  * blue zones where people live longer
  * sweet potatoes in Okinawa, Japan, or tortillas, beans, squash, and fruit in Costa Rica
  * consume a lot of plant-based food
  * Not sleeping enough wreaks havoc on our immune systems, weight, brains, and general health.
  * People need at least five hours and 45 minutes of sleep a night. Some people require eight hours or more a night.
  * have a regular bedtime, avoid computers and smartphones before bed, and sleep in a cool dark room.
  * A challenging job helps keep your brain healthy. So does learning a new language, or traveling to new places, or learning new skills.
  * you should get a hearing aid if you can’t hear what people around you are saying
  * People with untreated hearing loss have a 90% higher rate of dementia than others in their age group
  * Chronic stress, however, puts you at greater risk of anxiety, depression, memory problems, weight gain, digestive issues, muscle pains, heart disease, stroke, and sleep loss
  * Regular exercise, meditation, yoga, and even participating in a religion can be useful ways to understand and possibly alleviate stress.
