  * Denmark’s central bank sold 47 billion kroner ($7.1 billion) last month to protect its euro peg, the biggest monthly currency intervention to weaken the krone in seven years.
  * With the sale, Denmark’s foreign currency reserves jumped to 529.8 billion kroner at the end of December 2021.
  * The bank uses currency interventions to steer the krone in a tight band to the euro and changes its interest rates when those interventions become too great.
  * Its benchmark deposit rate is already at minus 0.6%.
  * Denmark has had negative rates longer than any other country.
