Notes from https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-are-i-bonds-everything-you-need-to-know-to-earn-nearly-10-interest-11650543039?mod=livecoverage_web
  * $22.3 billion of I Bonds were purchased this year through September
  * The I Bond interest rate is based on a calculation tied to the consumer-price index.
  * Bonds bought from May through the end of October will earn 9.62% for six months
  * For example, a \$10,000 I Bond bought in October 2022 would earn an annualized rate of 9.62% for 6 months. At that point, the interest earned of \$481 would be added to the original $10,000 and the new (expected) annualized rate of 6.47% would be earned on \$10,481, resulting in another \$339 in interest for a total of \$820 in interest earned over 12 months.
  * I bonds aren’t available in tax-sheltered vehicles such as individual retirement accounts, Roth IRAs or 401(k)s.
  * Brokers and financial advisers cannot purchase I bonds for you
  * During the time that the I Bond is held, there are no federal taxes due. Even though you’re getting the benefit of compounding interest every six months, you don’t pay any federal taxes until you actually cash out the bonds.
  * There are no state or local taxes on the interest earned
  * Traditional bank certificate of deposits (CDs) are subject to both federal and state taxes as the interest is earned
  * Interest is paid in a lump sum when the bond is cashed.
  * An I Bond earns interest monthly from the first day of the month in the issue date, so if you purchase a bond on Oct. 20, you would get interest for the entire month of October.
  * The interest is compounded twice a year, accrues for up to 30 years or until you cash the bond, whichever comes first.
  * You can cash a minimum of \$25 at a time, and must leave at least \$25 in your TreasuryDirect account when doing partial redemptions. 
  * The annual I Bond purchase limits are based on the recipient, not the giver. The child could receive up to $10,000 in electronic I bonds.
  * You can add an additional $10,000 to the annual I Bond purchase limit with a properly registered trust
  * When you register your account at TreasuryDirect, you have the option to create an entity account, including trusts and partnerships.
  * Trusts require an account manager that can act alone on behalf of the trust

  * Borrowers can ask their brokerage firms or banks to set up either a margin loan or a securities-backed line of credit tied to their investment account.
  * Raymond James requires that borrower's account size is >= $150,000.
  * Retirement accounts like IRAs are prohibited from this.
  * The mix of assets in a portfolio will determine the amount that can be borrowed
  * Typically, it is set as a percentage of the account
  * Borrowing against investments is cheaper (3% for margin loans vs. 5.8% for a 30-year mortgage)
  * Since there is no underwriting, it is much faster and easier process than obtaining a mortgage
  * Firms typically allow borrowers to tap up to 50% of the market value of their account, but sticking closer to 30% will give you more of a cushion to play it safe.
  * Margin-loan holders should check the mortgage rates quarterly. That way if the mortgage rates become comparable to the margin loan rate, they could switch to mortgage.
  * The interest you pay for a margin loan generally isn’t fully tax-deductible. You can only deduct that interest against any investment income you earn. With a traditional mortgage, you can deduct all the interest for loans up to $750,000 if you itemize your deductions.

  * Decentralized exchanges aren’t actually brokering trades on behalf of their customers or facilitating the execution or settlement of the trades.
