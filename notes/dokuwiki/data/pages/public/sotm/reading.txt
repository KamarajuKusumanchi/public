  * Written by Richard Cookson.
  * Based on this article, I think he writes good quality articles and analyzes the problem well.
  * So far this year, the Federal Reserve has purchased about \$490 billion of the \$2.7 trillion of the Treasury’s net issuance.
  * That still leaves the tidy sum of $2.2 trillion that needs to find a home.
  * Some $16 trillion of bonds globally have yields that are less than zero
  * Normally, any foreign investor buying U.S. assets would have to take currency risk. But because short-term rates in the U.S. are so low and the Fed has flooded the world with dollars, foreign investors can buy U.S. Treasuries hedged into their own currencies with a huge pick up in yield compared with local alternatives, thanks to something called a cross-currency basis swap.
