  * Cardiac arrest is when the heart abruptly stops beating.
  * It occurs when the heart’s electrical system malfunctions.
  * Abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias can be triggered by congenital defects, heart damage and certain medications
  * arrhythmias can lead to cardiac arrest
  * ventricular fibrillation, a serious type of arrhythmia
  * commotio cordis
  * Both heart attack and heart failure can lead to cardiac arrest. But they are separate conditions.
  * A heart attack occurs when blood flow, which carries oxygen, to the heart muscle is reduced or stopped. It is usually caused by blockages in the coronary arteries.
  * Symptoms of a heart attack can include chest pain, shortness of breath and pain in the arms and back
  * Heart failure is a chronic and progressive condition in which the heart can’t effectively pump blood around the body. Possible contributors include build-up in the coronary arteries, previous heart attacks, high blood pressure, obesity, congenital defects, lung disease and diabetes.
  * Cardiac arrest is sudden and characterized by abrupt collapse and loss of consciousness. A person in cardiac arrest will have no pulse and won’t be breathing.
  * Defibrillator is a device that delivers an electric shock to the heart and can restore a normal heartbeat in cardiac arrest patients
  * While waiting for a defibrillator to arrive, CPR should be administered.
  * Chest compressions can help to manually circulate blood, which can be life-saving to a person whose heart is not beating properly. 
  * Everyone should learn how to administer CPR and use an AED (automated external defibrillator).
  * Cardiac arrest is usually fatal. Fewer than 12% of people who have a cardiac arrest outside of a hospital survive. CPR significantly increases the odds of survival.
