Troublueshooting:
  * Per https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/15529#issuecomment-701478178 , the ID and collection name must match their respective values in the Collection URL, not the display name.
<code>
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/<USER ID>/<COLLECTION NAME>/
</code>
<WRAP indent>So, for example, given a collection named "Abc Def", you must enter "Abc-Def" (note the dash) as the "Collection name" in the "Add-ons" screen.</WRAP>
