In the quarter report, go to pg-28 (Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) -> Results of Operations which has the below table

Manufacturing, service and retailing                               2,982      3,025
Non-controlled businesses*                                           568        282 
Investment and derivative contract gains (losses)                 27,439     (1,580)
Other                                                               (111)       370 
Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders    $ 35,504    $ 5,580
------------
*  Includes certain businesses in which Berkshire had between a 20% and 50% ownership interest. 
</code>
To get the operating earnings, subtract "Investment and derivative contract gains (losses)" from "Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders"

So, the operating earnings in Q1 of 2023 are
<code>
>>> 35504 - 27439
8065
</code>
and the operating earnings in Q1 of 2022 are
<code>
>>> 5580 - (-1580)
7160
</code>

So, the operating earnings increased by 12.6%
<code>
>>> round( ((8065 / 7160) - 1)*100, 1)
12.6
</code>

Notes:
  * The 12.6% and $8,065 million match with the numbers mentioned in the last paragraph of https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-annual-shareholder-meeting <code>
Berkshire’s first-quarter results were released earlier on Saturday morning,
showing a 12.6% rise in operating profit, to $8.1 billion.
</code>
  * https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230506005003/en/ shows that the operating earnings are \$8,065 million and \$7,160 million in Q1 or 2023 and 2022 respectively. This matches with the above calculation.
    * This press release is a bit easier to understand about operating earnings compared to my approach. But I do not know how to generalize it for other quarters (ex:- how to get the corresponding businesswire link?).
    * I found businesswire link in https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-inc-first-quarter-2023-earnings-release-e6e998bf
  * The operating income can get revised at a later point in time. For example, https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220430005003/en shows that the original operating income for Q1 2022 was \$7,040 million. But https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230506005003/en shows that it got revised to \$7,160 million.

===== dummy =====
==== net earnings vs operating earnings ====
When it comes to Berkshire, we should look at operating earnings instead of net earnings.

Berkshire holds a lot of stocks in their portfolio. As per the new GAAP rules, the stock portfolio's performance should be included into the earnings (even if they are not realized). So pure earnings will be very volatile. Whereas the operating earnings tell how the business is doing (and does not take into account of their stock portfolio).

As an example, consider their Q3 2024 earnings. https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/news/nov0224.pdf shows

<WRAP indent>
{{:brk_q3_2024_earnings.png|}}
</WRAP>

Net earnings went from -\$13 bln in Q3 2023 to \$26 bln in Q4 2023. Operating earnings went from \$11 bln to \$10 bln in the same period. So the business did slightly worse while the GAAP earnings paint a rosy picture.
