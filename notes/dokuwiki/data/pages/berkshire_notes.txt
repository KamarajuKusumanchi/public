Investment and derivative contract gains (losses)                 27,439     (1,580)

Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders    $ 35,504    $ 5,580
------------
*  Includes certain businesses in which Berkshire had between a 20% and 50% ownership interest. 
</code>
To get the operating earnings, subtract "Investment and derivative contract gains (losses)" from "Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders"

So, the operating earnings in Q1 of 2023 are
<code>
>>> 35504 - 27439
8065
</code>
and the operating earnings in Q1 of 2022 are
<code>
>>> 5580 - (-1580)
7160
</code>

So, the operating earnings increased by 12.6%
<code>
>>> round( ((8065 / 7160) - 1)*100, 1)
12.6
</code>

Notes:
  * The 12.6% and $8,065 million match with the numbers mentioned in the last paragraph of https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/berkshire-hathaway-warren-buffett-annual-shareholder-meeting <code>
Berkshire’s first-quarter results were released earlier on Saturday morning,
showing a 12.6% rise in operating profit, to $8.1 billion.
</code>
  * https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230506005003/en/ shows that the operating earnings are \$8,065 million and \$7,160 million in Q1 or 2023 and 2022 respectively. This matches with the above calculation.
    * This press release is a bit easier to understand about operating earnings compared to my approach. But I do not know how to generalize it for other quarters (ex:- how to get the corresponding businesswire link?).
    * I found businesswire link in https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaway-inc-first-quarter-2023-earnings-release-e6e998bf
  * The operating income can get revised at a later point in time. For example, https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220430005003/en shows that the original operating income was \$7,040 million. But https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230506005003/en shows that it got revised to \$7,160 million.
