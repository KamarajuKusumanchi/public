==== issues in one drive ====
  * Onedrive does not remember the sort order when I open a file and close it. This is very annoying when I have a folder of pdf files and want to browse them through the left/right buttons.

  * In onedrive.com, the previous and next buttons are not appearing when browsing a folder of pdfs
