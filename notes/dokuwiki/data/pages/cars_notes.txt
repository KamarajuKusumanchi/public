  * Teslas do not have a spare tire. If you get a flat tire, you need to tow the car. In the traditional cars (ex:- Subaru), a donut, jack and lug wrench are included by default. But in the electrical cars, it looks like towing is the only option.
  * Honda Accord hybrid also does not have a spare tire.
