Created Tuesday 14 July 2020

Exercises of the form a - b = _

Suitable for | people learning subtraction

Instructions
* Do not repeat the same question in more than one exercise
* Must be chosen so that there are no inherent patterns.
For example, the following is not a good exercise sheet
9 - 1 = _
8 - 1 = _
7 - 1 = _
6 - 1 = _
since the learner can theoretically fill in the answer without actually looking at the question based on the pattern.
